# Face-Mask-Detection
Collaborate with Duc Combi

### Face-Mask-Classifier
This is the notebook that We are current working on:

https://www.kaggle.com/combi2k2/mask-classifier

This is the dataset we used for training our model for mask-classifier:

### Face-Detection
The videos we learned to get the knowledge to build the model:
<li> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDPWywWRIRo</li>
<li> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vr5rs_cTKCs</li>
<li> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tkgOzQ9yyo</li>

We will try to build a model for human detection first, just to know how a R-CNN work.

The URL to the dataset we will use for checking our model:

<li> https://www.kaggle.com/ichchhayakantnetweb/widerface </li>

We will take this model as reference:
